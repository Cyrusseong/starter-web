The MyAppBar widget creates a Container with a height of 56 device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels, both on the left and the right. Inside the container, MyAppBar uses a Row layout to organize its children. The middle child, the title widget, is marked as Expanded, which means it expands to fill any remaining available space that hasnâ€™t been consumed by the other children. You can have multiple Expanded children and determine the ratio in which they consume the available space using the flex argument to Expanded.
