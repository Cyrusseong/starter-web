realwork: <add title>

When writing an app, you’ll commonly author new widgets that are subclasses of either StatelessWidget or StatefulWidget, depending on whether your widget manages any state. A widget’s main job is to implement a build() function, which describes the widget in terms of other, lower-level widgets. The framework builds those widgets in turn until the process bottoms out in widgets that represent the underlying RenderObject, which computes and describes the geometry of the widget.
